### File to Binary and Binary to Video 

### Video to Binary and Binary to File 

This project provides tools to perform conversions between files and binary data, and between binary data and video files. You can use these utilities to:

- Convert any file (e.g., text, image, etc.) into binary format and restore it from binary.
- Encode binary data into a video file.
- Decode binary data from a video file and convert it back to the original file format.

   

### Features
- **File to Binary**: This tool takes a file as input and converts it into binary format.
- **Binary to File**: This tool takes binary data as input and converts it back into the original
file format.
- **Video to Binary**: This tool takes a video file as input, extracts the binary data from 
it, and saves it as a binary file.
- **Binary to Video**: This tool takes binary data as input, encodes it into a video
file, and saves it as a video file.
- **Binary to Video with Custom Video Settings**: This tool takes binary data as input,
encodes it into a video file, and saves it as a video file with custom video settings.
- **Video to Binary with Custom Video Settings**: This tool takes a video file as input,
extracts the binary data from it, and saves it as a binary file with custom video settings.
